# My-Modded-Minecraft-Server
A Full Release package to join my RPG Server.

To join the server, you will first need Curseforge or the mod folder for the standard launcher.

For CurseForge:
Download and install Curseforge here: https://www.curseforge.com/download/app
Click "Create a Profile" at the top right, then click "Import"
Click the .zip file down below and then click "Open".
It will then download the zip package to CurseForge.
All mod keybinds have been removed in game to let players choose their own keybinds for each mod.
Will progressively update modpack to be more challenging.
Modpack will be updated inconsistantly, all client mods must be updated by client.

For Standard Launcher:
Install latest version of Forge 1.20.1 - https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.20.1.html
Run as admin and install client, click done when prompt is available.
Download the zip file and unzip for "mods" folder.
Press Win+r, type "%appdata%", open ".minecraft" and paste the unzipped mods folder in the ".minecraft".
Close everything and run the launcher running the profile "Forge 1.20.1".

(I would recommend using 8Gb of ram to play for a smoother experience. To add more ram on CurseForge, click Play ->
Installations -> "..." -> MORE OPTIONS -> RESET -> change the -Xmx2G into -Xmx8G then save. You will have to do this everytime.)


You will have to update all your mods manually when the download arrows appear.

(I do not own any mods in this modpack, no money is made from this modpack, all rights are reserved by mod authors, and I will take it down upon their request.)
